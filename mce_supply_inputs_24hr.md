# MCE Supply Input Data Contract -- 24 hour assignments

The following files specify the supply input data contract for the MCE tool. These inputs are specific to the 24 hour peak-spread assignments. All input data are OMX or CSV format and located in the ./\_mceInputs/ subdirectory for each alternative.
 
 For each input, *time period* defines the hour of the assignment period. Format is <start + end hour>. Time periods are as follow:
