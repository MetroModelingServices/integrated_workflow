# MCE Supply Input Data Contract

**Emme modeller python script to calculate supply network reliability:** 
Run the following script in a Cygwin bash shell on the final assignment emmebank scenario's (pm2 and midday):
  ```
  python mce_reliability_prep.py
  ```
This command creates link attributes needed to calculate @relvar. Cross-check with settings.yaml file that all extra attributes have been populated on the network after running python script. The extra attribute @ctype is assummed to be copied from a prior scenario.

Next, run Emme macro skim assignment:
  ```
  auto_skims_MCE.mac
  ```
Resulting skims will hold the travel time variance. The square root of these skims is used in the benefits calculator to arrive at the standard deviation (reliability) of travel time. 

**Emme modeller python script to export OMX matrices and extract link attribute data:**
Requires New_Project.emp files created at reliability ./skims and final assignment ./assign directories. 

Run the following command in a Cygwin bash shell:

  ```
  bca_Emme_Export.bat
  ```
This script exports Emme network link attributes and all OMX matrices (Emme derived). 

**ITHIM:**
Uses tdist, wdist, and PA walk/bike OMX matrices from demand model.

Run the following command in a Cygwin bash shell

  ```
  mce_ithim.R
  ```
To run the ITHIM R active transportation benefit calculator, configure the following settings at the top of the script:
  - projectDirectory_base = "data/base-data"
  - projectDirectory_build = "data/build-data"
  - projectDirectory_run = "data/run/ithimR"
  - GBDFileForITHIM = "burden.portland.csv"
  - PopulationFileForITHIM = "F.portland.csv"
  - WALK_SPEED = 3
  - BIKE_SPEED = 10
  - AVG_HH_SIZE = 2.4
  - DOLLARS_PER_DALY = 80000

The script will write out the dalys.csv output file with three columns - coc, dalys, and dollars.
